# üé• AI-Powered Zoom Meeting Automation Flow

## Overview

This project provides a **fully automated end-to-end flow** using [Make.com](https://www.make.com/) and external services to handle **Zoom meeting recordings**. Once a Zoom meeting ends, the system:

1. Downloads the cloud recording.
2. Uploads it to Dropbox.
3. Sends the file to **Fireflies.ai** for transcription.
4. Summarizes the transcript using **OpenAI ChatGPT**.
5. Emails the final result (Dropbox link + summary).

The automation eliminates manual tasks and ensures meeting information is accessible, summarized, and shareable right after each session.

## üß† Use Case

## üö¶ Error Handling

- **File not found** ‚Üí Add delay to wait for Zoom to finish processing

*Description*:

The recording file cannot be downloaded from Zoom. Possible causes:
- The download URL has expired
- Authentication is required
- The file is missing or malformed

*Fallback*:
- Route the error to a separate branch using Make's *Error Handler*
- Send an alert email with the subject: `Zoom Download Failed`
- Log the failed file info (meeting title, start time) to a Google Sheet for manual review

- **Fireflies Transcript Not Ready** ‚Üí Retry after delay or fallback to Whisper API

*Description*:  
- Fireflies.ai may take time to process and return the transcript.
- If queried too soon, the transcript content will be missing or incomplete.

*Fallback*:

- Add a sleep module to delay processing (e.g., wait 3‚Äì5 minutes)
- Implement retry logic or loop (e.g., retry Get Transcript up to 3 times)
- If the transcript is still not available:

    Send a placeholder email

    Log the transcript ID for retry later
  
- **OpenAI timeout or truncation** ‚Üí Use chunking for large transcripts

*Description*:  

- Summarization via ChatGPT may fail due to:

    Incorrect input format (e.g., empty string, bad structure)

    Invalid API key or endpoint (e.g., 404)

    Rate limits or temporary downtime

*Fallback*:

- Use an error route to send a fallback email without a summary

- Include the transcript (if available) or a message to check manually

- Optionally log the failed input and error message


- **Email delivery failure** ‚Üí Retry logic or add webhook alert
