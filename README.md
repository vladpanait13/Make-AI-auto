# 🎥 AI-Powered Zoom Meeting Automation Flow

## Overview

This project provides a **fully automated end-to-end flow** using [Make.com](https://www.make.com/) and external services to handle **Zoom meeting recordings**. Once a Zoom meeting ends, the system:

1. Downloads the cloud recording.
2. Uploads it to Dropbox.
3. Sends the file to **Fireflies.ai** for transcription.
4. Summarizes the transcript using **OpenAI ChatGPT**.
5. Emails the final result (Dropbox link + summary).

The automation eliminates manual tasks and ensures meeting information is accessible, summarized, and shareable right after each session.

## 🧠 Use Case

> After a Zoom meeting that was scheduled via Google Calendar and recorded in the cloud ends:
>
> - Automatically handle the recording
> - Generate and summarize transcripts
> - Distribute them via email
